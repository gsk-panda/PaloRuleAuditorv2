Examples for these would be enough to design the SSH-based flow:
1. From Panorama (SSH to Panorama)
A command that shows rule hit counts, ideally for a single device group (e.g. the one you used for the API test, like ISS or CRP), so we see:
How the CLI is invoked (exact command and any options).
How the output is structured: rule name, hit count, last-hit time (or similar), and how device/target is identified (e.g. serial, hostname, vsys).
Example of what we’re looking for:
Command: e.g. show rule-hit-count device-group <name> or show device-group <name> rule-hit-count (exact syntax from your version).
Raw output: a full paste of the result for one device group.
2. From a managed firewall (SSH to one firewall)
The same kind of rule hit count command, but run on one firewall (so we see the per-device view):
Exact command (e.g. show rule-hit-count or whatever your PAN-OS version uses).
Raw output: a full paste so we can see how rule names, hit counts, and timestamps (and vsys if present) are printed.
We’d use (1) to see if we can get “all rules in device group X” in one shot from Panorama, and (2) to see the per-firewall format in case we need to SSH to each firewall and correlate back to device groups. So the one example we’d want first is: the Panorama SSH command and full output for one device group; then, if you can, the same for one firewall.
