On Panorama, the target (which firewalls a rule is deployed to) is part of the rule config. You can see it over SSH with the device-group and rulebase CLI.
Show one rule (including its target):
show device-group "ISS" pre-rulebase security rules "Allow Non-prod bastion to vlan91"
Replace "ISS" with the device group and "Allow Non-prod bastion to vlan91" with the rule name. The output should include a target (or similar) section listing the devices.
Show all rules in the device group (config, including targets):
show device-group "ISS" pre-rulebase security rules
Then find the <target> / <devices> section for each rule.
If your PAN-OS uses set-style config:
show config running device-group ISS pre-rulebase security
or, for a single rule, the path that corresponds to that rule in the config hierarchy (exact path can vary by version).
Scripting-friendly (structured output):
set cli scripting-mode onshow device-group "ISS" pre-rulebase security rules "Allow Non-prod bastion to vlan91"set cli scripting-mode off
So: use the device-group + pre-rulebase security rules (and optionally the rule name) in show device-group ... or show config running ...; that’s the SSH side that corresponds to “which firewalls are targeted for this rule.” If you paste a sample of that output, we can map it exactly to the API’s <target><devices> and to the “Device Name” column in the rule-hit-count table.
